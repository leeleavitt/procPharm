\title{Function taht creates a ide stat automatically if you have all control and test window regions in the data.
To make this work you can't half ass your window regions you must include all control window regions}

  controlToUse = c(1, 2, 3)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{statType}{"max", "snr", "tot" are entries into this}

\item{controlToUse}{this is an integer input to specify the testPulse to use for control is lefft NA, the pulse prior to the pulse is control pulse}

\item{testPulseNames}{this is the test pulse names that contains the experiments, examples include "^[kK].*40" or "^[aA][cC][hH].*300[uU][mM]" or "ATP"}
