# Mac OS procPharm Setup

1.  Install [XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg](https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg/)
2.  Install [GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg](http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg)
3.  Now Open `R` and type
````
install.packages('cairoDevice')
````
  * Make sure to click *Install Dependencies*

  * R should prompt you to select a CRAN location. I used USA (OR) just because it is close to Utah


### A couple of notes
Please do not go fullscreen (ie the green button) it causes the RDViewer and other functions to break and as of right now YOUâ€™LL HAVE TO START FROM YOUR LAST SAVE
 \
It runs a little slower than on the computers at the lab, but be patient (especially with `ROIReview`)
